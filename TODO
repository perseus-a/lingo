= ToDo list for lingo

(most important first)

== General considerations

* New code *should* meet the guidelines outlined in the RubyStyleGuide
  <http://www.rubygarden.org/Ruby/page/show/RubyStyleGuide>, existing code
  will be adjusted along the way.
* New comments and documentation and stuff *should* be in English, existing
  texts will be translated as time allows. Use Ri18n or Ruby-GetText for the
  UI (to not loose existing translations).

== Specific features

* Reorganize file and module structure (directories: bin/, config/, dict/,
  lib/{lingo,tasks}; Lingo namespace).
* Refactor Rakefile (lib/tasks/).
* Update some older documentation (particularly, the README).
* Package lingo as gem, allowing it to be installed system-wide, with user
  documents, dictionaries and configuration files separate from system files
  and dictionaries. (Location for user configuration and dictionaries, maybe:
  ~/.lingo)
* Use OptionParser (optparse) or similar for command-line processing instead
  of custom-made routines.
* Allow for handling of documents in various encodings, not just the one the
  dictionaries are encoded in.
* Provide automatic encoding detection.
* Provide automatic language detection (as fine-grained as possible).
* Make lingo run faster!? (benchmark - profile - optimize)
* Make sure the Crypter is sufficiently secure.
* Provide a DSL for configuration -- in addition to or instead of the current
  YAML format.
* Use RSpec for testing.
